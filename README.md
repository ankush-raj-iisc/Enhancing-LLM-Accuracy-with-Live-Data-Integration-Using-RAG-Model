# Enhancing LLM Accuracy with Live Data Integration: A RAG Initiative for Canoo (US Based EV Producer)
* This project aimed to elevate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within Canoo, a US-based electric vehicle producer, by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
* Utilizing cutting-edge internet search APIs and custom search engines, the initiative dynamically sourced live, accurate data from a variety of online platforms, including social media and news sites.
* This approach allowed the LLM to access the most current research, market trends, and industry analysis, enhancing its response accuracy and relevance.
* By employing a diverse toolkit including Scrapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, google-search, and requests, the project significantly contributed to Canoo's strategic decision-making processes, ensuring the LLM remained a potent tool in navigating the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market.

# Steps Involved:
1. Identify Data Sources: Selection of internet search APIs and custom search engines for live data extraction.
2. Tool Selection: Utilize Scrapy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, google-search, and requests for web scraping and data retrieval.
3. Data Extraction: Implement scraping scripts to dynamically extract live data from selected sources.
4. Data Integration: Integrate the extracted data with the LLM, enhancing its knowledge base with up-to-date information.
5. RAG Implementation: Develop and apply RAG techniques to augment LLM prompts with relevant, live data for improved response generation.
6. Continuous Update Mechanism: Establish a system for the asynchronous update of external data sources to maintain the freshness of the information.
7. Testing and Optimization: Conduct thorough testing to refine the integration and ensure optimal performance of the augmented LLM.
8. Strategic Application: Leverage the enhanced LLM for strategic decision-making, including industry analysis, competitor analysis, and market trend insights.
