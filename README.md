# RAG-Model-Based-Analysis-of-Canoo-a-public-company
Developed a RAG model-based Python script to efficiently gather and analyze data on Canoo, a publicly traded company, utilizing internet search APIs.
Extracted information on industry analysis, competitor analysis, market trends, and financial performance, contributing to strategic decision-making processes, using libraries ( Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, JSON, CSV,scrapy, selenium, beautifulSoup, duckduckgo-search, requests).

The project entailed utilizing Python programming to gather market research information for an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing plant, focusing on Canoo, a NASDAQ-listed company. The approach involved a literature study and API exploration, where SerpAPI, Azure, and Google Cloud Platforms were assessed. Challenges arose with SerpAPI's inaccurate search results and data extraction difficulties, prompting a shift to Google's Custom Search Engine (CSE) for improved result relevance and easier data management.

The main steps included:
1. Literature Study and API Exploration: Evaluating different APIs for extracting search results.
2. Customized Search Engine Setup: Transitioning to Google CSE after initial challenges with SerpAPI.
3. Extraction of JSON File: Obtaining search results in JSON format for analysis.
4. Conversion of JSON to CSV: Isolating and converting the necessary JSON data into a CSV file for further use.


Challenges included SerpAPI's insufficient search result accuracy and the complexity of aggregating data from various queries. These were overcome by switching to Google CSE for more precise search capabilities and handling one query at a time to ensure data clarity.
